## Steps to Run the Application

1. First, activate the virtual environment with the following command:
    ```bash
    name-environment\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Then, install all the libraries with the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Now, navigate to the app directory and run the app with the following command:
    ```bash
    cd app-directory
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

Make sure to replace `name-environment` and `app-directory` with the correct names of your virtual environment and the application directory, respectively.
